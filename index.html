        <h2>About Us:</h2>
        <h3>We are a small group in Water Valley, MS. We want to raise money for teens who can't afford all the things they need for college. Like books, hygiene products, snacks and etc. If you want to go out and buy some of the products that would be greatly appreciated. We would love for the young adults to have everything they need.</h3>
